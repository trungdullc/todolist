# Lessons Learned
```
Vibe Coding:		Can finish this product in 5 to 30 minutes, but learn nothing but prompting AI
Reviewing Code:		Takes 5-8 hrs to understand the CSS and Javascript it just repetition

JavaScript done in INSPECT in browser different than using Node.js and starts with node to open a script
JavaScript is loose language so if you want to make it stronglytyped used TypeScript
Tips: Don't learn css use ChatGPT or other AI since they faster, if you had to then use an IDE with IntelliSense

1st Approach: console.dir() is very useful
2nd Approach: Type out the class or function or variable no need console.log()
3rd Approach: Math.getPropertyValue()
