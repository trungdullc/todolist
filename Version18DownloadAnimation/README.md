# Day 18: Download Button changes colors yellow/green when mouse over and clicked
```
Boss: "Lets make the UI more user friendly.  I believe we need to add more colors.  Hey, I've got an idea.  Every time
a person clicks the Download button they won't know if the file is downloaded until they see a notification from
the browser.  Lets make it so when you hover over the Download button it turns yellow and when you click it will turn
green like a street light.  Aren't you impress, now I need you to get coding."
