# Day 07: Sound on clicking add
```
Boss: "My eyes are filled with joy, but my ears are displeased.  I need some simulation for them when using this app.
Can you add some sound when you click on the add button."

# Lessons Learned

preload attribute that tells the browser how to load the audio file before itâ€™s played
Note: id is popSound
	<audio id="popSound" src="../sounds/pop.mp3" preload="auto"></audio>

Need JS to getElementById
	const popSound = document.getElementById("popSound");
	// const popSound = document.querySelector("#popSound");	// modern way
	
Side Quest: Using querySelectorAll (for multiple elements)
	// Returns a NodeList of all elements matching the selector
	const allButtons = document.querySelectorAll(".btn");
	
	allButtons.forEach(btn => {
		btn.addEventListener("click", () => console.log("Clicked!"));
	});

addBtn.onclick = () => {
    popSound.currentTime = 0;
    popSound.play();
};
